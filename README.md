# 📰 The New York Times - Homepage

A detailed, static **HTML and inline CSS** recreation of a typical The New York Times homepage. This project serves as an exercise in **front-end development**, focusing on replicating a complex newspaper layout using modern web design techniques like **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**, all implemented directly through `style` attributes.

## ✨ Features

- **Authentic Design:** Mimics the distinctive look of The New York Times with classic **serif typography** (`Georgia`/`Times New Roman`) and a restrained, newspaper-style color palette.
- **Structured Layout:** Uses a multi-part layout (**header**, **nav**, **main content**, and **footer**) to separate concerns.
- **Responsive Grid:** The main content section utilizes a **two-column grid** (2/3 for news, 1/3 for opinion/features). The bottom news section features a responsive card grid to display various categories.
- **Inline Styling Focus:** All presentation logic is contained directly within the HTML's **`style` attributes**, showcasing proficiency with atomic styling or email-template-like construction.
